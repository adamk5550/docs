## Overview

Git is an open source version control system covered by the [MIT license](https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/blob/master/README.md#license). It is currently the most popular version control system in use and ubiquitous in programming.

## Advantages

The following selling points make a compelling case for using Git and are why Newcastle Mobility uses Git on all of its projects:

- **Centrally stored code**  
The master copy of each Git project is stored in one place, typically on a server. No more disparate code scattered between multiple developers.

- **Incremental versioning**  
Git stores updates as references to the previous update. This ensures projects don't rapidly balloon in size and allows for rollbacks to any point in time.

- **Concurrent collaboration**  
Git allows multiple developers to modify the same code at once through branching changes and intelligent merging.

## Concepts

This section will cover the most important concepts in Git which are key to understanding how Git works. If you are not using Git yourself but are working with developers who are, this section will give you an insight into the terms they use and what it means.
