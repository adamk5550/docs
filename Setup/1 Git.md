# Setup 1: Git

## Overview

Git is a distributed version control system used by the Newcastle Mobility team to manage code, during and after development. It provides the following benefits:

* Allows for a centralised code store on a server.
* Acts as a backup solution, allowing rollbacks.
* Facilitates multiple developers working on the same code at once.

This page will guide you through installing Git, using SSH keys to authenticate with Gerrit for code review purposes, and cloning your first project repository.
